_A game where you can't touch your own colour_
I mean you actually can't. Try it. You'll fall straight through.
It's meant for puzzles, even has a level editor. Basically you fall through whichever colour you are. Based off of my first game jam game (of which there are no surviving copies that I know of).

To play open with love2d _(I should really compile these)_
I honestly can't remember the keybindings so _**Good Luck**_
